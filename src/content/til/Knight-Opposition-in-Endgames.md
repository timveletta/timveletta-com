This one I picked up reading Levy Rozman's new book [How to Win At Chess](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/125107160 "How to Win at Chess") and talks about dealing with chess endgames where you have a King and Queen or Rook versus a solitary King. Its a situation I have struggled with in the past, often causing stalemates, but the concept of **Knight** **Opposition** is key to closing out this winning position.

The key to **Knight** **Opposition** is in moving "your Queen to a square where--if your queen were a knight--it would be checking the \[opposing] king." This also works in King and Rook endgames albeit slightly differently.

With a Queen endgame, the key is to do this until the opposing King is moved into a corner before moving your own King over to aid in the checkmate. In doing so, we must give the opposing King 2 valid squares for them to move between in order to prevent stalemate.

After doing so, it is just a case of moving your King into place so that it protects the Queen when it goes for the checkmating move adjacent to the opposing King.
