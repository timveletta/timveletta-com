This one I picked up reading Levy Rozman's new book called How to Win At Chess and talks about dealing with chess endgames where you have a King and Queen or Rook versus a solitary King. Its a situation I have struggled with in the past, often causing stalemates, but the concept of **Knight** **Opposition** is key to closing out this winning position.
