> TL:DR I finished top 4 in the Baddest Batch $2k Tournament for Star Wars: Unlimited this past weekend in Sydney.

This past weekend myself and 2 others from Perth, Blake and Shawn, made the trip over to Sydney for what was an amazing showing for Star Wars: Unlimited in Australia. Having travelled to the first Planetary Qualifier or PQ in Melbourne last October, I told myself I would chill on travelling for card game events for a few sets, leaving it to be a once a year thing at most.

This was until the Baddest Batch announced they would be hosting a $2k tournament on the same weekend as Sydney PQ. If you haven't heard of the Baddest Batch, they're a group of awesome people that run a Star Wars: Unlimited podcast and YouTube channel along with casting other SWU events including our own Perth PQ the previous weekend. I highly recommend you check them out at [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBaddestBatch) and wherever you listen to your podcasts.

Once the back to back events were announced, along with the support of a very loving partner; the grind was on!

The day started out at a reasonable time, although my body didn't agree considering it was still 3 hours behind; with some poached eggs on toast with 2/3rds of the Baddest Batch crew then it was onto the venue to help them setup. As players started to filter in, I could feel my anxiety and excitement rising, but after the swerve to Sabine ECL for the Perth PQ the previous week and resulting poor showing, I was back on my comfort pick of Sabine Yellow so it was time to throw some curveballs.

My list for the $2k and PQ was as follows:

It was the same list that Rebel Resource got 2nd with at the Minnesota PQ which he detailed in a [video on his channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-2RxIM8a3A).

## Round 1 vs Sabine ECL

With everything set up and everyone briefed, it was time to play! My first round opponent was a Sabine ECL which I was shocked about considering everything that I had heard about the Sydney meta. In the lead up to the weekend, I was told that only Baddest Batch member, Clint, played Sabine ECL but with the way the meta in general is, your deck must be prepared to face Sabine at some point so it was down to business.

Or was it?! I proceeded to draw poorly and play even worse by trying to control down my opponents units when I should have been applying pressure in order to force out an ECL prior to the 5 resource turn. Game 1, he ECL Poe to clear all but one unit and in game 2 he ECL Wrecker to Overwhelm me to death and so, the submarine began.

As a side note, in talking to my opponent after the game, he mentioned that he had brought a Sabine deck to the $2k in order to have a less intense day in order to preserve energy for the PQ which seemed to be the case for a number of others there on the day.

## Round 2 vs Anakin Blue

A matchup that I haven't played much of in a while but I was confident into it since they generally play one unit a turn and I'm going super wide so I can generally push through for the win before Anakin is much of a factor. Both games I played a Sabine unit on turn 1 since it effectively neutralises Village Protectors on turn 2 and then its just a case of playing around the remaining Sentinels and removal that the deck runs. I managed to take game 1 convincingly and in game 2, I played an A-Wing on turn 2 and my opponent responded with a Concord Dawn Interceptors which allowed me to pivot to ground and go wide. I played Plo Koon on 5 resources knowing that if he played Obi Wan on 6, I'd be able to take care of it immediately but it was Plo Surprise Striking for 9 that took the game.

## Round 3 vs Sabine ECL

After the loss in round 1 to the same matchup, my confidence in it was starting to wane but some timely messages of encouragement from the Perth SWU community along with it now being a time that my body is used to being awake at gave me that extra energy.

Game 1 did not go as planned as my opponent played 2 Rebel Assaults which is usually too much for me to deal with and it was at this point, that my tournament life was probably on the line. In game 2, I was able to land an A-Wing turn 1, into a Wing Leader followed by a Red Three and Cartel Turncoat and win through space before a pesky Poe could ECL to ruin my day. Game 3 was progressing evenly with my opponent playing Rebel Assault with his first action on the 4 resource turn; I had a decent board presence and was pushing damage and I had a feeling he was setting up to Fleet Lieutenant his Sabine leader with the remaining 3 resources so I Bamboozled it discarding a Millenium Falcon only for him to confirm my suspicions with his next action. Preventing that 5 damage on my base was enough to give me the game and series win.

## Round 4 vs Sabine ECL

Yet another Sabine! Of the 7 Sabines at the event, I managed to face 4 of them (spoilers for later). There were 5 Sabine ECL and 2 Sabine Yellow including myself.

In game 1, I effectively used the same game plan as last round by lane dodging although my opponent, had some tricks up his sleeve in a cheeky Echo Base Defender to put a dampener on my Sabine flip turn, or so he thought! I had a Red Three to drop so Sabine could clear the Sentinel and again the armada of space ships took down the base for the game 1 win. Game 3 was much of the same, my opponent going to ground, me in space and once he used ECL to play a Sundari Peacekeepers on the 5 resource turn, I knew I was home.

## Round 5 vs Han Yellow

Before this game, both myself and fellow Perth legend Blake sitting at 3-1 and I just knew, that if we were matched up in the next game, it would be the stream game and it turned out to be true.
