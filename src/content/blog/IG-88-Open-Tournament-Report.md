The day started out unlike most others, I don't normally eat breakfast, but we made our way out to The Shorehouse to celebrate my sisters birthday. The coffee was below par and when you're charging $24 for a Belgian Waffle with fruit on top, you better hope there are 2 waffles on that plate. To my dismay, the waiter presented me with a plate with just a single waffle on it and a mountain of fruit. But I couldn't dwell on that for too long, I said goodbye to my family and set out to win a sweet IG-88 showcase.\


The decklist I brought into the day was as follows:

Despite going 0-3 at the last 2 Beskar Forge events, I was somewhat confident going into the day as long as I could avoid the Boba Fett. I had been smashing games on Karabast the whole week and felt like I knew the match ups well enough but continually struggled into Boba which is somewhat expected. 

Also since the event was double elimination; 2 losses and you're out so 

Round 1 vs Ash Boba Cunning

Round 3 vs Paul Han Vigilance

Round 4 vs Matt Sabine ECL

Round 5 vs Joe Sabine Cunning

Round 6 vs Andrew Vader Command

Round 7 vs Kevin Chirrut Aggression

Final vs Luke Boba ECL
