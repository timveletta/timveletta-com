The day started out unlike most others, I don't normally eat breakfast, but we made our way out to The Shorehouse to celebrate my sisters birthday. The coffee was below par and when you're charging $24 for a Belgian Waffle with fruit on top, you better hope there are 2 waffles on that plate. To my dismay, the waiter presented me with a plate with just a single waffle on it and a mountain of fruit. But I couldn't dwell on that for too long, I said goodbye to my family and set out to win a sweet IG-88 showcase.\


The decklist I brought into the day was as follows:

Since I had gone 0-3 at the last 2 Beskar Forge events that I attended; confidence levels were not high and given it was double elimination, I was prepared for an early day. Having said that, I had been smashing games on Karabast all week and felt like if I could dodge the Boba Fett matchup, I might be able to make it a few rounds.

I must also give props to the guys at Beskar Forge for experimenting with different formats. In the lead up to the IG-88 Open, you could collect Bounties weekly for things such as having a winning record with a deck containing only commons and uncommons or bringing a friend. Those bounties were used to seed players into the bracket for the Open
